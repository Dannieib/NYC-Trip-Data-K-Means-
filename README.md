# NYC-Trip-Data-K-Means-


Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will construct a K-Means Python application using a dataset acquired from the Registry of Open Data on AWS. You will be using PyCharm as your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  

Here's a step-by-step guide to aid you in completing this assignment. There will be additional details of this guide in the assignment instructions. 

Dataset Selection: Visit the Registry of Open Data on AWS and select a dataset that aligns with your project requirements. 
Setting up PyCharm: Install and set up PyCharm, if you haven't done so already. This will be your IDE for this assignment.
Developing the K-Means Python Application: Import the dataset into your Python application. Next, implement the K-Means algorithm to perform clustering on your dataset. Remember to follow good coding practices and ensure your code is clean and well-commented.
Unit Testing: After you've developed your application, it's crucial to perform unit testing to ensure that your code is running as expected and to catch any potential bugs or errors.
Executive Summary: Finally, develop a one-page Executive Summary in Microsoft Word. This should include an overview of your work, the challenges you faced, how you overcame them, and any interesting findings from your application.
